# SharePoint
Welcome SharePoint-Gurus!!!  Hoping we can keep usefull scripts and cmdlets here as a way to easily track changes and make suggestionis.
I also created a Slack account to try and see how the two interact so feel free to join that as well.  Think using both of these in unison could be a pretty slick way to keep track of what everyone is using to accomplish different tasks.

Slack is also name "SharePoint-Gurus" but I may have to send invites, still a newb to all of this.
